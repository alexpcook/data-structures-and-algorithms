package queue

// Queues operate on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) paradigm
// - Lookup O(n) (not a typical operation)
// - Enqueue O(1) (similar to push, adds an entry to the queue)
// - Dequeue O(1) (similar to pop, removes the entry that was added first to the queue)
// - Peek O(1) (view the first item to come out)
